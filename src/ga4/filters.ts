 * composing nested and/or/not groups from a free-form schema gets it wrong
 * often; a flat list of conditions combined with AND covers what people
 * actually ask for and can be validated completely before a request is spent.
 *
 * A filter that cannot be built raises. It is never silently dropped; a
 * filtered question that quietly returns whole-site numbers is worse than an
 * error, because the number looks right.
