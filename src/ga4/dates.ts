 *
 * The API accepts relative tokens (`today`, `yesterday`, `NdaysAgo`) and
 * resolves them in the property's timezone. So the rule here is: emit a
 * relative token whenever the request is relative, and fall back to absolute
 * dates only for calendar boundaries ("last month") that have no token form.

 * with the first). A plain Error falls through diagnose() into the generic
 * "UNEXPECTED" bucket, which carries the fix "Run doctor to check the setup"
 * and the exit code for "Google refused". Parsing happens entirely on this
 * machine and never touches a socket, so a mistyped range was being reported
 * to somebody as Google turning them down, with a fix that could not help.
