/**
 * Optional local audit log.
 *
 * Off unless `privacy.auditLogPath` is set. When on, it records what was
 * *asked*, never what came back. A log that contained report rows would be
 * exactly the personal data this skill works to keep off disk, so response
 * bodies, row values and totals never reach it.
 *
 * One part of the question is held back for the same reason: a filter's value.
 * Which fields were filtered on and sorted by is recorded, because that is what
 * says whether a report was about a person at all; what they were filtered *to*
 * is not, because that is the person.
 *
 * This is the only module in the skill that writes to a file, which is what
 * makes the "nothing is written to disk" claim checkable: `surface.test.ts`
 * asserts no other shipped module calls a write API.

     * The field names a filter narrowed the report to, and the field name it was
     * sorted by. Names only, never values.

     * The dimension and metric lists above describe the shape of the answer; they
     * do not say which slice of it was asked for. A report whose columns are page
     * paths and dates can still be a report about one named person, because the
     * filter is what selects the rows and the filter field never appears as a
     * column. Recording only the columns made exactly that query indistinguishable
     * in this log from an ordinary whole-site one.
     *
     * The *value* is deliberately absent, and that is not an oversight to be
     * fixed later. A filter value is the identifier itself (a customer id, an
     * email, a URL with a token in it), so writing it here would put the personal
     * data this skill keeps off disk onto disk, in the file people enable to feel
     * safer. The field name answers "was this a question about a person" without
     * answering "which person".
