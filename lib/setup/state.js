/**
 * Reduces the checks runDiagnose produced to the single step that would
 * unblock setup, in dependency order.
 *
 * Two checks never reach `mapped`, on purpose:
 *
 * - A check with no `code` at all (the privacy-settings check, which is not
 *   error-driven) is outside this taxonomy entirely: it is a standing
 *   posture, not a reason a report cannot run, so it is not treated as
 *   blocking. It is not silently dropped either: a failing one lands in
 *   `warnings`, because "your reports are unredacted" is something the agent
 *   has to be able to say, and `ok: true` with nothing beside it said the
 *   opposite.
 * - ADMIN_API_DISABLED is skipped when the "data_api_report" check
 *   specifically passed later: that is the one check that actually proves
 *   reports work. Matching on *any* later check passing is wrong: runDiagnose
 *   always appends a "privacy_settings" check after it, and that check
 *   passes on essentially every real run (redaction is on by default), which
 *   would satisfy an "any later pass" predicate whether or not reports ever
 *   ran at all. That would hide the one genuine blocking step and send
 *   someone in a loop: told to run `properties` to fix "no property
 *   selected", which fails with the same ADMIN_API_DISABLED. Matched on
 *   `id`, a stable identifier, rather than `label`, which is display text
 *   somebody will reword.
