 * Three jobs, in order of how much they matter:
 *
 * 1. Redact. Every dimension value passes through redaction on the way out.
 *    This is the last point at which a stray email in a URL can be stopped.
 * 2. Frame the data as data. Dimension values are visitor-authored (anyone
 *    can put text in `pagePath` by visiting a URL), so rows go inside a fenced
 *    block introduced as untrusted, never interpolated into prose, and the
 *    same framing travels with the structured `rows` field below: a value
 *    with no personal-data pattern in it redacts to nothing, so an
 *    injection attempt reaches a model with no warning at all unless the
 *    warning is attached to the data itself, on every channel it travels.
 * 3. Say what the numbers do not mean. Thresholding, sampling and `(other)`
 *    rollups all make totals wrong in ways that are invisible unless stated.

 * `rows` field, for a different reason: a value that starts a line of its
 * own reads differently to a model than one buried mid-sentence, regardless
 * of whether the surrounding document is markdown or JSON. JSON's own
 * escaping keeps the document structurally valid either way; it does not by
 * itself stop injected text from reading as its own line once a model
 * attends to it. Applied once, upstream in `body` below, so both channels
 * share this single pass rather than each doing (or forgetting to do) their
 * own.
 *
 * Exported for the one place a value reaches text *outside* the fenced block:
 * the caveat line saying what a report was filtered to, which interpolates a
 * filter value into prose (src/ga4/filters.ts and src/tools/reports.ts). That
 * value comes from the agent's own argv rather than from Google, so the risk
 * is lower, but it is the single exception to the framing discipline the rest
 * of this module enforces, and sharing this one function is what keeps the
 * two from drifting.

 *
 * Substitution, not escaping, and that is the whole point. The previous
 * implementation escaped, `cell.replace(/\|/g, "\\|")`, and it was exactly
 * backwards for a value that already contained a backslash: `\|` became `\\|`,
 * which GFM reads as an escaped backslash followed by a **live** pipe. The
 * escape converted an already-harmless pipe into a working delimiter. A visitor
 * loading any page on the site with `?q=pricing\|999999` on the end gets that
 * string into `searchTerm` verbatim; it matches no personal-data pattern, so
 * redaction passes it through, and `report search_terms` then emitted a
 * five-field row under four headers. `eventCount` read 999999 instead of 3,
 * every later metric shifted one place, and an agent relayed a fabricated
 * figure to a non-technical user as a measured number. Same reach through
 * `pagePathPlusQueryString`, `landingPagePlusQueryString`, `pageTitle` and
 * `?utm_campaign=`.
 *
 * Escaping correctly (backslash first, then pipe) would also work, but it keeps
 * the value's ability to forge structure one ordering mistake away. Removing
 * the delimiter from the value means no escape sequence is involved at all,
 * which is the property worth having on a channel a model reads: there is
 * nothing left to get wrong. The cost is that a literal `|` in a value reads as
 * a fullwidth one, which is visible, honest, and cannot shift a number.
 *
 * Newlines go too, for the reason flattenNewlines exists: a bare newline starts
 * a line that reads as a fresh `| ... |` row.
